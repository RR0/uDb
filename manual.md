# *U* UFO DATABASE
# MAPPING and RESEARCH TOOL 


 NOTE:  Please see README.DOC file on enclosed diskette, or in your
    C:\UFO subdirectory after installation.  New routines, data,
    sources and errata may make this manual partly out-of-date!


 WHAT is *U*?    *U* is a DATABASE of quality UFO sightings worldwide,
 from antiquity to the present.  *U* runs under DOS, directly or from
 within Windows 95/98.   There is no Macintosh / Apple version.


 WHAT does *U* DO?   QUITE A FEW things!   From the MAIN MENU:

 EXIT PROGRAM!  ( We make it easy. )...  press [0] or [Esc] key.

 - OPTION 1)  Here you display the text of actual sightings.  You may
 modify or delete existing records.   You may ADD YOUR OWN listings.
 Special keys show instant maps of the highlighted record.

 - OPTION 2)  Plays the 'Flying Saucer Theme' on a simulated theramin.

 - OPTION 3)  SEARCHES entire database for records matching your
 Search Limits (filters).  Records are displayed sequentially.

 - OPTION 4) Is a repetitive DEMONSTRATION ROUTINE.

 - OPTION 5) Calls a completely separate STATISTICS FUNCTIONS menu with
 numerous specialized routines.   More on this later.

 - OPTIONs 6, 7 and 8  display Flat, Spherical or Overlaid color maps
 of UFO sightings worldwide, in any scale.  Option 8 permits overlays
 of up to FOUR different SETS of sightings in contrasting colors.

 - OPTION 9) Is a Data Search like Option 3, but echoes the filtered
 records to the printer.  At least one source reference shows.

 - OPTION R) Displays a pop-up REFERENCES window for quick lookup. 
 This usually shows full publishing information.

 - OPTION U) Calls a separate menu of Files Maintenance UTILITIES.


 > ALL FUNCTIONS are FULLY FILTERABLE by some 90+ Search Paths,

## *U*  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:                        

> See README.DOC for possible changes in installation procedure.

1)  DO you already have a subdirectory  C:\UFO?   IF SO, the *U*
Database files will go right in there with any previous files.
IF NOT, the installation diskette will automatically create the
new folder C:\UFO.  Program, data etc. will all go there.

2) Insert diskette in any 3.5" / 90mm  drive, usually drive A:

3)  Execute INSTALL.EXE directly from the diskette.  Do NOT copy
INSTALL.EXE or any other diskette programs elsewhere.  They need
to see the original diskette to work!  It is best to do all of 
this in Windows 95 or 98.  There is no need to drop to DOS.

4)  *U* will start up automatically and immediately after 
installation.  NOTE:  You might see a false "Out of Memory" error
message.  Ignore this!  It is caused by INSTALL and *U* itself
both running at the same time.   It will go away and stay away.

For subsequent sessions, simply execute U.EXE from the the C:\UFO
subdirectory.    Windows 95/98 users will want to create a shortcut
to U.EXE,  which is the main program in this application.


## *U* OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS   

As soon as you execute U.EXE ...

Green messages show proper files and sufficient memory are found.
Problems will show up in RED.  BLUE lines suggest corrective action.

ALL MENUS and most displays offer a HELP SCREEN.
Press [F1] whenever a screen or display is not self-explanatory.

THE MAIN MENU screen will then appear.  Some Files Statistics are
windowed on the right.  >> The MAIN MENU is on the LEFT. <<

TO SELECT AN OPTION:  Press a single key, ( 0 - 9, R, U.. ) -or-
   Use up/down arrow keys and press [Enter] -or- Click your mouse.

Option [0] EXIT.
   *U* and returns to your operating system, i.e. Windows or DOS.

Option [1] EXAMINE RECORDS.  
  3 to 5 records will show at screen bottom.    The ACTIVE RECORD has 
  YELLOW characters and TAN background.     TAGGED records will have a 
  GREEN BACKGROUND.  You may tag or untag any record.    

  4 other records usually show, with BLACK characters for perspective 
  and comparison.  Records are kept in chronological order.
  [ See UTILITIES MENU to sort records back into order.]

  A Green Box above the Records Window shows the Active Record Number.
  >>  Any editing changes you make affect the ACTIVE RECORD ONLY. <<

  At the Upper Left is the ATTRIBUTES matrix.  Blue-background Attributes
  apply to ACTIVE RECORD only.   [ See Appendix II for definitions. ]
  More fields show at screen upper-right; Date/Time accuracy, Reference,
  Environment, Strangeness/Credibility ratings and so on..   


MAIN MENU:   OPTION 1)  EXAMINE/EDIT Records  (cont.)

[F1] key calls a HELP window which explains the keystrokes below.

[Esc] The "Escape" key returns you to the MAIN MENU.  
[Esc] will back you out of practically any undesired screen or routine.

The 4 ARROW KEYS:  UP/DOWN arrows step you forward/backward, one record at a time.
Left and Right arrows shift the cursor for the green boxes at screen bottom .. 
[Enter] key executes selected action immediately.  Click mouse on any green box.

The [Ctrl] Control key magnifies the effect of many OTHER keys you may hit.  
For example, [Ctrl]-[Up Arrow] shifts you up by 100 records instead of one.
     
[Page Up] and [Page Dn] shift you up/down by 10 records.
[Ctrl][Page Up]/[Page Dn] jump 100 records up or down.

[E]  ( The regular E key ) is "EDIT ACTIVE RECORD"    
Caution! You will be asked which fields to alter!   Press [Esc] to get out 
of this for now.  Full editing instructions follow on page 11.

[F]  FLAT MAP.  This displays a map with the Active Record centered, and 
pointed out by green arrows.
[Z]  ZOOMED MAP.  The same as [F] above, but "zoomed-in".
[@]  (asterisk, the shifted '2' key) does an EXTREME zoom-in.

[M]  JUMP AHEAD ONE MONTH.    [N]  JUMP BACK ONE MONTH.
    
[F9]/[F10]  These keys jump to previously 'found' or altered records, 
if any, resulting from previous searches and editing.

[Y] or [G]: JUMP to a given YEAR.  For years prior to 1920, key in ALL 4 digits.  
For 1920 onward, type in the LAST TWO digits only. 
The FIRST RECORD for that year becomes the ACTIVE record.

[R]  REFERENCES POP-UP WINDOW:  *U* References shown by number.  
UP/DOWN ARROW keys step through reference list.  [Esc] exits.

[P]  Planetary Positions at date and time of the ACTIVE RECORD.
Horizon Coordinates (Azimuth, Altitude and Distance) replace the usual data 
at screen upper-right.  See APPENDIX VII for details.
Press [P] again to toggle back to the regular display.

[T]  TAGS a record.  [U] UNTAGS it.  [V] FINDS all tagged records.
Ctrl-T (Control-T) and Ctrl-U will perform a BATCH TAG or BATCH UNTAG. 
You definitely want to set search limits for a batch-tag operation!  
Tagged records are windowed with a green background.

[F4] Forces an instant 3-line hardcopy printout of the active record.  
All fields will print except for the box-matrix of 64 Attributes.

[F5] Is a pop-up window; a lookup routine for acronyms and abbreviations.  
E.g.  Type in AFOSI and press the ENTER key.  A subroutine will look up this   
Air Force acronym.  [F6] & [F7] are exactly like [F5], BUT definitions appear 
in (poor) French, or Spanish.
     
[Home] jumps back to Rec #0001. [End] Jumps to most recent record.

-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   

MAIN MENU:  OPTION 2)  Two bars of flying saucer music.  
  (  Sorry,  I couldn't resist.  -LH )

MAIN MENU   OPTION 3)  DATA SEARCH: Sequential Screen-Dump.

YOU impose SEARCH LIMITS based on any/all or none of the 90+ Search
Paths, in any combination.  Records which PASS ALL TESTS are displayed
sequentially.  Press [Enter] (etc.) to see the next one.  [Esc] = quit.

EACH Search Limit will EXCLUDE some records.  You may filter records
by ranges of dates, attributes, continent and/or country, environment,
strangeness and/or credibility, longitude/latitude ranges, reference,
time of day ranges or date-time accuracies, a custom set of months-of-
the-year..  See APPENDIX I, full instructions setting SEARCH LIMITS.

After the final record shows, you return to EXAMINE/EDIT mode.
Choose MAIN MENU OPTION 9 for DATA SEARCH with Hardcopy Printout.
   
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

MAIN MENU OPTION 4)  Demo Routine. An endless Display of 
various screens, turned on and off at random, until you exit.  
Press [Esc] 2 or 3 times to return to the Main Menu.

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

MAIN MENU OPTION 5)  STATISTICS OPTIONS MENU.

All Statistics functions may be filtered by search limits;
(See Appendix I.)   Press [0] or [Esc] to exit from Statistics Menu.


 Here, we loop out of the Main Menu for a full listing of the
 Statistics Menu Options:


 STATS #1)  SIGHTINGS FREQUENCY HISTOGRAMS:  (several displays)

 After crunching numbers, nine ( or so ) displays will appear in
 sequence.    Press the UP arrow to see the previous screen, and
 the DOWN arrow to show the next display.

 Display #1:  A dual histogram of YEARS and MONTHS.  Years are on top.
 The RED year is broken down into months on the bottom.  Use Left/Right
 ARROW keys to shift years.  [Page Up] and [Page Dn] keys shift left and
 right by 10 years.  Month-bar sizes are RELATIVE to one another for
 one year only, and re-scaled as space allows for each Year.

  Sightings counts for years and months appear under each bar.
  01 is January, 02 = February  ..... 12 = December.

  Keystroke instructions show in white so there is no [F1] HELP here.
  DOWN ARROW takes you to Display #2..

 Display #2: Sightings by Months, cumulative, REGARDLESS of year.

 Display #3:  Sightings counts by weekdays.  This is cumulative,
 without regard to years, months etc.   Set search limits as needed.

 Display #4 is an HOURLY breakdown, without regard to day or date.
 With NO Search Limits, you get a very noteworthy curve which may
 represent peoples' sleeping habits in part.  As always, UP and DOWN
 Arrow keys navigate between these displays.

   

   ( Statistics Function #1 continued..)                            [5]

Display #5:  A Histogram of "Year-days" (1 to 366) for all years
permitted by search limits.  Major meteor showers are shown in
colors.  The white curve is an 11-day moving-average.

Display #6:  The sky is divided into 24 "hours" of longitude.
For any UFO sighting, some stellar meridian is directly overhead;
depending on date, time of day, and local longitude on Earth.

Roughly equivalent to "Right ascension" in astronomy tables; "Zero
hours" is on the Vernal Equinox, 19 hours is in Sagittarius toward
the galactic center.  Declination is not factored in here.

Display #7 is "Moon-Hours".  "Moon-Noon" occurs when the moon is
directly over the local meridian (not necessarily overhead).  This
has NOTHING to do with moon phases or time of day.  IF the moon is
on the meridian when an event occurs, the 12 hrs count increments.

Display #8  divides data by "Continents", or more accurately
Global Regions.  Many regions provide little useable information.

Display #9  divides records into "environs" such as Urban, Farm,
Residential, High Seas, Desert, Road and Rails etc.

-  -  -  -  -

STATS #2:  SIGHTINGS CONCENTRATIONS.  You enter SEARCH RADIUS in miles.
Press DOWN ARROW for default value of 75 miles.  You enter a TIME
RADIUS.  (Press DOWN ARROW for default +/- 30 days).  The algorithm
scans for events falling within the TIME AND SPACE RADII, i.e. the
same general time and place.

Set search limits (or not) as usual.   Data retrieval is automatically
limited to years after 1900.   If your miles or days "radii" are too
restrictive, you  may find nothing at all.

-  -  -  -  - 

STATS #3   STATE/PROVINCE BREAKDOWN: Again you may set Search Limits.
Records crunched are limited to the USA (incl. Puerto Rico), Canada,
Britain and France.  Sightings are counted by State and Province for
USA and Canada.   France and Britain are included for comparison.
8 screens will show the ratios of Sightings per 1000 square-miles area,
per 1000 Population, and other ratios.  Listings are sorted by highest
and lowest ratios, to find which geographic areas stand out.
Use up/down arrow keys to move thru 8 different summary text-screens.

-  -  -  -  -

STATS #4   STRANGENESS / CREDIBILITY COUNTS.  Based on Search Limits,
Strangeness and Credibility ratings are counted for each of 16 levels
from 0 through 'F' (in hexadecimal notation).

-  -  -  -  - 

STATS #5   SIMPLE EVENT COUNT:  Set Search Limits as usual.  The
function counts records that pass the filter.   Totals are displayed,
broken down by continents and countries .. quick and dirty numbers.

-  -  -  -  -  

STATS #6   ATTRIBUTES COUNTS:  Set Search Limits as usual.   Each of
64 attributes will display the number of times it was set "true", for
all records that pass the search-limits filter. 


   STATISTICS FUNCTIONS  (cont.)                                     [6]


   STATS #7   REFERENCE COUNTS:  You set Search Limits.  Each of 255
   References shows how many times it was cited as primary reference.

   -  -  -  -  -

   STATS #8   LOCAL RECURRANCY SPECTRUM:  This looks for any regular
   TIME INTERVALS between UFO REPEAT APPEARANCES in any general area.

   >> SET AT LEAST ONE SEARCH LIMIT  (Continent, dates .. something!)

   You are allowed only 9000 base records for any one execution.
   For each record, a sub-search scans ahead thru ALL subsequent records,
   for events within about 5 miles (8 km) radius.   If these are found,
   the time interval is tallied in months.  For 9000 records, this is
   over 40 million cross-checks, thus the 9000-record limit.

   The result is a graphics screen, with a running average which makes.
   trends more visible.  Different Continents, Decades, Attributes etc.
   result in very different "curves" on the graph.  This routine is
   extremely slow due to its recursive nature!

   -  -  -  -  -

   STATS #9:  50 YEARS of SIGHTINGS.  White dots indicate event counts
   for 600 months from 1947.  An 11 month "running average" smooths the
   data, showing trends as a violet curve.   The slow grey curve is
   Venus proximity to Earth in Astronomical Units (AU).  The red curve is
   for Mars.   Note particularly close approaches in 1956, 1971 and 1988.

   -  -  -  -  - 

   STATS #A  ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK:  Given YOUR Longitude, Latitude, Date,
   Time, time-zone and Daylight Savings (Summer) time switch, the Sun
   Moon and Planets are constantly updated in 3 coordinate systems.
   You may enter any HYPOTHETICAL coordinates etc.     See APPENDIX VII.

   -  -  -  -  -

   STATS #B   BUSIEST DAYS IN THE DATABASE.  Set Search Limits as usual.
   The function counts events for every calendar day.  The dates with
   the highest scores are sorted to the top of the list.  Press [Esc] to
   abort the search, and see the busiest days found so far.

   -  -  -  -  -

   STATS #D:  DAY versus NIGHT:  Sightings are divided into Day, Night
   and "fringe" hours.   Fringe hours are those which may be light or dark
   depending on latitude and season.   Sightings counts are broken down by
   decades, to show some dramatic changes in day / night ratios over long
   periods of time.    The causes of this effect are unknown.

   -  -  -  -  -

   STATS #E   FILE EXPORT:  Function creates an ASCII (text) file you
   can send to any drive from A: to D:.  Exportable fields are Year;
   Month; Month-day; Year-day (1-366);  Longitude/Latitude (East and
   South are NEGATIVE);  Time of day;  Strangeness and Credibility. 

   To prevent software piracy, not all fields are exportable
     [ Statistics Menu: [E] files export cont. ]                        

 All characters are ASCII encoded for import into other applications.
 Each Field ends with a TAB character (Ascii 9) for even columns and
 separate fields.   Each Record ends with a Carriage Return (0D0A hex)
 An End of File character ("EOF" = FF hex.) terminates the Export file.

 -  -  -  -  -

 STATS #F: FREQUENCY SPECTRUM:  Data is divided into WEEKS, with counts
 for each week in UFO history (per the data, and any search limits you
 may set).   A pseudo-spectrum-analysis looks for recurrent time-spans
 between sightings, regardless of where or when they took place.   The
 violet curve plots a running average of recurrency in weeks.  Peaks in
 this curve indicate the time between waves and so on.  The green karat
 symbol ^ indicates KNOWN intervals between some major waves.   Colored
 letters V,M and J indicate the regular periods between close approaches
 of Venus, Mars and Jupiter.   Oddly, Venus and Jupiter play minor roles
 compared to Mars in these displays.   This may partially reflect the
 systematic exclusion of junk (night light) sightings from the data.

 -  -  -  -  -

 STATS #L  LONGITUDE / LATITUDE COUNTS:  This simple routine counts
 sightings by unit degrees of Longitude / Latitude.  Negative Longitudes
 are East of Greenwich.  Negative Latitudes are South of the Equator.
 Especially high counts are highlighted with a blue background.

 -  -  -  -  -

 STATS #P  PLANETARY PROXIMITIES:  The SOLAR LONGITUDES of Venus, Mars,
 Jupiter and Saturn are compared to Earth for each sighting.  Histograms
 show 24 zones of RELATIVE sidereal longitude.  Zone 12 means the planet
 is CLOSEST to Earth, zone zero means it is on the opposite side of the
 Sun; WITHOUT REGARD to the stellar sphere.  Set search limits as usual.

 -  -  -  -  -

 STATS #T  TRAJECTORIES COUNTS.   For about 23% of the data, a FINAL
 direction of travel is indicated as >N (etc.)   'which way they WENT'.
 Trajectories are divided into the 4 compass points  N. S. E. and W.
 >NE, >NW, >SE and >SW each increment TWO counters;  >NNE becomes North,
 >ESE becomes East (etc.) giving equal weight to N.S.E and W.  Findings
 are then subdivided into Continents and decades.
 THIS concludes the STATISTICS MENU.  Other features may have been added
 since this printing.   See README.DOC.     Now, back to the Main Menu.
 
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

MAIN MENU OPTION 6)  FLAT MAPS.  Flat maps are projected with      
PARALLEL Longitude and Latitude lines, much like those old school-maps
showing Greenland larger than South America.  Flat Maps and allow Mouse
Retrieval of UFO records by clicking on the corresponding pixel.
When you call Option 6, a list of keystroke instructions appears.

[F1] HELP:  A small Help window explains where you are, and suggests
further keystrokes.  IF you already have a map displayed, [F1] simply
returns you to the initial keystrokes list.

[M][L] calls a list of pre-programmed maps; 2 or 3 letter MAP-CODES
like CA for California, or CHI for the Chicago area.   All US States,
Canadian Provinces, and most countries have their own Map Codes.
The Map List is 2 screens long.   Press space-bar for the 2nd page.

Press any Map Code (e.g. SP for Spain) to display a map.  Sightings on
that map appear as white dots, subject to Search Limits if any.


   ( Flat Maps display options   cont. )                            [8]


   [S][L] calls for SEARCH LIMITS, the same filters used everywhere else.

   [T][M] switches to the TRIG-MAP  (Option 7 below).  The same area
   shows, search limits unchanged.  [F][M] switches back to a Flat map.

   >> You may Shift and Zoom to show any part of Earth, in any scale.

   Use the 4 ARROW KEYS to shift the map UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT by 25%.
   [Ctrl]-{arrow key} shifts by about 50%.   [Alt]-{arrow} shifts ~ 75%.
   Note the arrows on the numeric keypad, also up, down, right and left.
   THESE make HALF shifts, about 12% for finer positioning.

   Use the [Insert] key to ZOOM IN, enlarging the center of the Map.
   Press [Delete] to ZOOM OUT, viewing a wider area for perspective.
   Again, the [Ctrl] key (held simultaneously) gives a DOUBLE ZOOM, and
   the [Alt]-key yields a triple zoom.

   You may change the colors of the map outlines, and the "UFO dots".

   Type  DB, DG, DO, DV, DW or DY for blue, green orange, violet, white
   or yellow UFO dots.   The default is WHITE.  Type in OB, OG, OO, OV,
   OW or OY for black, green orange, violet, white or yellow outlines.
   The default is YELLOW (subject to change!)   Black makes the "map"
   disappear, leaving only the UFO dots.  Green outlines are quite dark.
   Orange outlines look 'spooky'.  Color settings remain active until
   you change them, or exit *U* entirely.   RC restores default colors.

   UFO DOT BRIGHTNESS is 2-pixels wide by default.  Press B1 for 1-pixel
   UFOs for greater precision of placement.  Press B3 for 3-pixels
   and greater visibility.  B2 returns to the default 2-pixel UFO dots.

   [L][+] turns on Longitude/Latitude lines.   These will help show the
   difference between flat and trig maps.   [L][-] removes the LL-lines
   to reduce screen clutter.

   The [Page Up] key displays 2 and 3 letter place-names on the map like
   ON for Ontario, and NM for New Mexico.  These markers appear only
   where map-space is available.   (A "zoom-in" will create more space.)
   [Page Down] turns this feature off.

   [S][+] turns on a noise-maker that 'beeps' as UFO-pixels are placed
   on the map.  Beeps are higher in frequency (pitch) to the East and
   South, lower to the West and North.  [S][-] turns the noise off.

   [R][+] ROTATION.  Usually, all valid UFO dots appear on the same map.
   In Rotation, 200 sightings appear.  Then, as more UFO-dots appear,
   the OLDEST UFO dots are removed!   You see activity move from place
   to place over time.   Try this!

   The [SPACE BAR] will FREEZE the dot placement cold.  Another [Space
   Bar] resumes dot placement .. and so on.   This works in regular or
   rotation map displays.

( Flat Maps display options ..  cont. )                            [9]

[S].  STOP sightings dot placement.  Further S keystrokes will place 
ONE UFO sighting dot at a time. To resume automatic placement, press 
the Space Bar once or twice.   
      
Rotation, Single-Step and [S][+] Sound, with  OO (Orange map outlines) 
gives an almost eerie effect.  
      
Try holding the [S]-key down to slow the Rotation placement down.
Try all of the above with TJ (trajectories) maps.

[D][D] limits sightings to a SINGLE DAY.  Try 1990, 11, 05 (05NOV90)
showing the USA map .. then try France.    Use Statistics option #6
to find the busiest days in the database, then use the DD map feature
to display them.  These one-day wonders are usually clustered in
particular countries or regions.  D- turns off the one-day feature.

[F][S] sends a "Flying Saucer" sailing right across your map in case
a group presentation is getting too tedious.  ( sorry. )

[T][J] SHOW TRAJECTORIES!   Some 23% of sightings show direction of
travel as  >N  or >>ESE in the 78-character text field.  If you type
TJ, the map will be redrawn with red arrows extending away from the
sighting.   ONLY the sightings with the > or >> arrows are plotted,
the other are omitted.   >ENE and >NNE are rounded off to >NE.
>WSW and SSW are similarly plotted >SW.

[T][J] works with the DD (single-day) map displays.  Try the
"busiest" days again, with TJ active.  T- shows the regular map, all
dots, and no trajectory arrows.

Ctrl-H  (Control H) is HARD COPY.   THIS ONLY WORKS on CANON BJ-200e
Bubble-Jet printers or the EXACT equivalent.  IF you have such a
printer, you can reproduce most maps and graphics screens.  IF NOT,
you will only print JUNK.  Time and cost constraints prohibit writing
graphics drivers for other printers.

==>  Use Windows [Print Scrn] to reproduce graphics screens on paper.

Press [S][M] to re-display the same map, or any default map.
Map Features (Sound, Color, Long/Lat lines, Rotation etc.) will stay
active until you shut them off ( S-, L-, R-...)  - or - until you
return to the Main Menu, where they are ALL reset.

MOUSE RECORD RETRIEVAL!  [ Flat map only! ]  When the "Saucer"
Mouse Cursor appears at screen upper-left, position it so the
'antenna' just touches one of the "sighting" dots.
A tight ( 2-pixel) tolerance helps isolate closely placed sightings.

Now, click the RIGHT button.  Record Number, date and general location
for that event will appear at screen lower left.  This same record now
becomes the ACTIVE RECORD.  IF you call the EXAMINE/EDIT screen, this
sighting will be high-lighted in the text window.

If you press the LEFT mouse button, the routine will look for other
nearby sightings.   Center mouse button, (or both buttons together
on 2-button mice) will exit the Mouse Retrieval algorithm. 

   ( Mouse Record Retrieval  cont.)                                [10]

   IF you Click (Right-Button) in a cluster of sightings, several will
   show in sequence.  Use LEFT button to step through them.  Use MIDDLE
   button (or both OUTSIDE buttons) to stop the search on any sighting.
   Anytime you press the LEFT mouse button, the Longitude/Latitude of
   the Mouse-icon will show in the upper left corner of the screen.

   NOW type CC.   The map shifts so that the Mouse-Clicked sighting is
   centered on the map.   You can jump to a different map anytime.

MAIN MENU  OPTION 7)   TRIGONOMETRIC MAPS.

A "TRIG MAP" is a section of the spherical Earth projected directly
onto the screen.   These maps work just like Flat Maps,  EXCEPT:
 a)  No Mouse appears .. you cannot retrieve records from the map.
 b)  Execution is slower on 286/386 systems with no Math Co-processor.
 c)  Large distances and geometries are much more accurate.

-  -  -  -   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

MAIN MENU OPTION 8)   LAYERED MAPS:

This option overlays 2, 3 or 4 maps with different sets of Search Limits.
Each layer shows corresponding events in different colored dots.
The first layer is light blue, followed by red, green and white.

The Layered Maps default to "Flat Map" display.  You can present them
mores realistically by pressing [T][M] (Trig Map) after the first

MAIN MENU OPTION 9)   HARDCOPY FILE DUMP.

Hardcopy works exactly like Option 3 (Screen File Search) ... EXCEPT:
a)   All sightings automatically are echoed to the PRINTER.
b)   You hit no keys between records .. these just print and display
     until the end of the file.   Press [Esc] key to halt printout.
c)   The Hardcopy output does NOT include the Attributes Matrix.

It is best to run any file search to the screen (Option #3) before
executing Option #9.   Make sure you are zeroed-in on the data you
want, and avoid wasting time, paper and ink.

EDITING RECORDS:                                     [11]

==> You are EDITING whenever you ADD, DELETE or CHANGE any record. <==

Select Main Menu Option #1, and center the desired record as the ACTIVE
RECORD, with the TAN background showing.

To EDIT the ACTIVE RECORD, press the [E] key.  The Records Window stays
in place.   A NEW list of Options appears at screen top-left.  9 sets of 
fields are shown.  Either Click the Mouse left button, or use UP/DOWN 
Arrows to step to the proper field, then press Enter.

Data entry for chosen field is exactly the same as for a NEW entry,
(see INSERTING below).  Have your new data ready beforehand.  Each Field 
has separate indications how to enter the data.  The [F1] HELP key is 
available at every step.  Use it.

New fields will keep appearing for editing.  When you have edited the 
fields you wanted, press [Esc] to return the the EDIT screen.  A pop-up 
box will ask if you want to save the changes or restore the original data.  
Press [Esc] again for the EXAMINE screen.

INSERTING and DELETING RECORDS

There is only ONE way to add a NEW record:  you "INSERT" it using the 
[Insert] key, in the EXAMINE/EDIT mode.   When you press [Insert], the 
routine searches for a DELETED record first, one that it can overwrite. 

One of two things will happen:
  a)  A record search will locate a record with a year greater than 2999
      (i.e. a DELETED record).  IF FOUND, THIS becomes the new
      Active Record.  All fields are blanked and ready for a new record.
  b)  Finding no DELETED records, a brand-new record-space is APPENDED
      to U.RND, with blank (dummy) fields, ready for a new sighting.
      >>  IF you INSERT a new record by mistake, simply DELETE it.  <<

NOW you will be asked for all the sighting details, field by field.
>>  Have the following information ready BEFORE you INSERT:   <<

  YEAR:    (-999 to 2049 AD)   Year of the sighting/event.
  MONTH:   (01-12)  If unknown use 01, or reconsider excluding the data.
  DAY:     (00-31)  Day of the month.  00 = unknown.
  HOUR:    (00-23)  LOCAL Military 24 HR clock.  Remember that each DAY,
           and hence its DATE  begins at 00:00, and ends at 23:59.
  MINUTES: (00-50)  Minutes after the hour, in 10-minute increments.
  ACCURACY:    For YEAR, MONTH, DAY and TIME, enter accuracy rating:
     0 = DOES NOT APPLY/irrelevant.    1 = UNKNOWN/Unspecified.
     2 = APRX: within 1 or 2 Years or Months; within 3-4 Days, Hours.
     3 = KNOWN:  EXACT year, month, day: Time within one hour.

  CONTINENT and COUNTRY:  SEE APPENDIX III  for list and details.

  STATE/PROVINCE:  SEE APPENDIX IV  for full details.
     Continent, Country and State are not always obvious.
     For example:  Puerto Rico is under Continent 0 (North America),
                   Country 2 (USA),  STATE/PROV = PRC for Puerto Rico.

  LONGITUDE and LATITUDE:  Both are in Degrees : minutes : seconds.
  Seconds are rounded to the nearest 20 seconds, about 630 meters.
              
                                                  ( Continued pg 12 )
( Inserting new records,  cont. )                             [12]

ELEVATION:  Enter elevation of OBSERVER above Sea Level in METERS.
RELATIVE Altitude:  Height of UFO above/below observer in METERS.
SUMMARY:   A 78-character text field, describes LOCATION and EVENT.
Always start with the LOCATION spelled out  e.g. MENLO PARK,CA:
Use commas as shown.  Avoid extra spaces.  Press [F5] for a list of
space-saving abbreviations and acronyms.   ALWAYS squeeze "CF"
in, if Longitude/Latitude is unknown or imprecise.  Use COLONS (:)
NOT COMMAS to separate different features of the sighting.

DURATION:  (0-32000 min.)  Approximate time elapsed during sighting.

TERRAIN:  (somewhat ambiguous)  Use METROPOLIS for events within the
  largest cities, TOWN for smaller cities/towns, Residential for
  Suburbs and housing districts/compounds.  Barracks are MILITARY.
  Farms are FARMLANDS.  Ranches, sheep stations etc. are PASTURE.
  Generally these are indicate population density and/or predominant
  land usage.  OIL & COAL are petrochemical recovery or refining.
 
  TUNDRA is any treeless, sparsely populated polar region.
  DESERT is just that, unless its a CITY in the desert.
  MOUNTAINS:  Any mountainous area, except as noted above.
  WETLANDS:   Swamp, estuary, marsh .. except as noted above.
  FOREST:     Thickly wooded areas except as above.
  RAINFOREST: Tropical jungles and forests with high precipitation.
  COASTLANDS: Within a few miles of the shore, except as above.
  OFFSHORE:   Coastal waters .. within a few miles of shore.
  HIGH SEAS:  Away from land.  Ships at sea.
  ISLANDS:    Smaller islands.  NOT Britain, Australia, Taiwan..
  IN-FLIGHT:  Observer in aircraft, especially if buzzed or paced.
  SPACE:      Any UFO event beyond earth's atmosphere.
  MILITARY:   Any military Base, Field, installation, camp..
  UNKNOWN:    Environment cannot be determined from source data.
  ROADS/RAILS:  Highways (NOT streets) railways, generally between
              towns, where none of the above clearly apply.

ATTRIBUTES:  Use the [F5/6/7] LOOKUP option and see APPENDIX II for
  tips on these important fields.  Activate all attributes than
  apply.  Reserve ODD for truly UNUSUAL features.  Strong indications
  of Dimensional or Paranormal Anomalies rate an ODD attribute.
  Reserve TCH for technical clues to alien technology in general.

  Use Arrow keys or mouse to maneuver around the Attributes Matrix.
  Press INSERT/DELETE key, or click LEFT/RIGHT Mouse button to
  Activate/Deactivate any attribute.   Active (valid) attributes are
  lit up with a blue background.

STRANGENESS:  (0-F hexadecimal)  Highly subjective "weirdness" rating.
  A structureless night-lite usually gets a rating of 5 or less.
  Points are added for landings, occupants, missing time etc.
  Deduct points for likely misidentified planets, aircraft etc.

CREDIBILITY:  (0-F hex)  Also highly subjective.  For Strangeness
  and Credibility,  Start with a rating of 5 or 6.  Add or subtract
  points according to the events.   Credibility increases with added
  witnesses, especially well trained and 'reliable' observers.
  Cult gurus fall directly to the opposite extreme.

REFERENCE:  Press the [R] key to find the source reference.  If YOUR
  source is not listed, use reference # 96,97,98 or 99 as applicable.
  Only our diligent programming staff can change the Reference List.
(Adding new records  The FIELDS .. cont.)                          [13]

PAGE NUMBER:  (0-999) The actual page within the reference above.
  Use the page number in YOUR copy.   For UFO Journals, enter ISSUE
  number, or Volume and Issue as applicable.  Specific page numbers
  are NOT entered for Journals, magazines, newsletters etc.

DELETING RECORDS:     The [Delete] key does only one thing: 
  It 'marks' a record as 'OK TO OVERWRITE', by changing the YEAR field 
  to the absurd year 3000 AD.

  a)  You can UNDELETE by simply putting back the correct year.
      Do this RIGHT AWAY, or the record may be over-written and lost.
  b)  IF you SORT the database (using the Utilities SORT routine)
      This record will be shifted to the bottom (end) of the file, based
      on Date.   It may be difficult to determine the original year..
  c)  IF you [Insert] a NEW record, it will overwrite the first
      Deleted record it finds;  the old record is gone!

APPENDIX I: SETTING SEARCH LIMITS  for all maps and functions.

There are TWO ways to set Search Limits:  INCLUSIVE and EXCLUSIVE.
INCLUSIVE limits will Map, Display, List or otherwise crunch data for
records that MEET ALL SEARCH LIMIT requirements.  (Default = INCLUSIVE)

Press [Esc] right away to set NO limits, i.e. the Entire Database.

EXCLUSIVE limits will REJECT records that meet ALL Search Limit
Requirements, and PASS ALL OTHER RECORDS!

To invoke EXCLUSIVE search limits, press the [X] key when you are asked
if you want to impose some particular limit.   Press [I] to revert to
the usual (default) Inclusive limits.

Example: You would use an EXCLUSIVE search limit to retrieve all sightings
         OUTSIDE of some given country.

  Note: IF you set TWO Search Limits:  for the USA and all of 1965:
  INCLUSIVE limits will only retrieve records meeting BOTH criteria.
  EXCLUSIVE limits will retrive ALL records outside of the USA,
    .. PLUS all records IN the USA but NOT during 1965.
    .. PLUS all records from 1965 that were OUTSIDE the USA!

For the default Inclusive Limits, each Limit EXCLUDES some records.
Too many restrictions will leave little if any data to process.
ONLY records that pass ALL LIMITS will be retrieved or counted.

From MAP DISPLAYS, type SL to call the Search Limits routine.

Statistics and Data searches automatically invoke search limits.

Press [ESC] as soon as you have imposed all your Search Limits.
The function or map will then execute immediately.  This saves time.


( Appendix I: Setting Search Limits  cont. )                      [14]

Limit #1)  SEARCH/DISPLAY BY DATE?   [Y/N/X/I]
  [Y] = Yes.  [N] = No.    Use arrow key and press [ENTER]  -or-
  press [Y] or [N] key  -or-  click Mouse on [Y] or [N]
  Press [ESC] for NO SEARCH LIMITS AT ALL  (the entire database).
  Press [X] for EXCLUSIVE Limits.  Default is [I] = Inclusive.

  If you select [Y] you will enter the Beginning and ending Years
  and Months.  The ending date must be later.  ALL RECORDS dated
  before or after your Year/Month time frame will be REJECTED.

Limit #2)  SEARCH by ATTRIBUTES?   [Y/N/X/I]  Select a key as above.
  [ESC] terminates Limits settings and starts actual data search.
  If YES, you press [P] PASS or [R] to REJECT records by Attributes.

  NEXT you enter Attributes by Highlighting them on the Attributes
  Matrix on screen upper-left.   Select any number as required.
  Use the mouse to click on desired attributes, or use arrow keys
  to step to the desired attribute, and press INSERT to SELECT an
  attribute, or press DELETE key to DE-select it.

  ==> Press [F1] for help on keystrokes here.  <==

  IF you select the [P] (pass) mode:  All records having ONE or MORE
  MATCHING attributes pass.   Records with NO matching attributes
  are REJECTED.

  IF you selected [R] (REJECT) the Matrix Cursor shows in RED.  In
  this mode, ALL records having ANY selected Attribute are REJECTED.
  >  Only those with NO matching attributes pass. <

Limit #3)   LIMIT SEARCH by PHRASE?  [Y/N/X/I]
  [N]  Omits this restriction, goes to Limit #4.
  [Y]  You then enter a search-phrase, up to alphanumeric characters
       including spaces .. then press [Enter].
       Records containing the search-phrase PASS, others FAIL.

  NOTE:  Text Search is CASE-INSENSITIVE by default.  "Omaha" will
  match for "OMAHA", and the record passes.  For a CASE-SENSITIVE
  search, hold down the [Alt] key and press [C].  ALT-C toggles back
  and forth between CASE-SENSITIVE and CASE-INSENSITIVE.

  The search routine examines TWO fields for a matching "phrase":
  a) The 78 character TEXT field, and b) the 3 chr STATE/PROVINCE field.
  If you look for the word fragment "UTA",  you will get every
  record in UTAh, plus typical words like  oUTAge, mUTAte, etc.
  Search phrases with 4 or more characters will scan the 78-character
  text synopsis field only.

  To LIMIT the search to the Text field ONLY, ADD the % character at
  the end.  For example, UTA%.  You will find words like bUTAne,
  without calling up a lot of UTAH records.  Similarly, to look for
  STATE/PROVINCE names only, add a carat symbol ^ (shifted 6-key) as
  the final character.

  Example: A search for ORE^ will limit the search to Oregon State.  

( Appendix I: Setting Search Limits .. cont. )                     [15]

Limit #4a) LIMIT by CONTINENT?  [Y/N].   [N] Omits this restriction.
  [ESC] Terminates search-limits.  Data crunching start immediately.
  [F1]  = The HELP screen  which gives a list of "Hotkeys."

  Some typical Hotkeys are U = USA;  C = Canada; G = Great Britain;
  D = Australia (Down under); E = Western Europe; F = France;
  B = Brazil; A = All North America;  J = Japan;  S = Spain;
  X = Mexico;  R = Argentina; I = Italy  ... etc.

  => Pressing a Hotkey will limit the search to a SINGLE continent
     or country, and BEGIN data crunching IMMEDIATELY.  <=
 [Y] You will select ONE "Continent" by number, 00 through 12.

Limit #4b) IF you Limit by Continent: you may now  LIMIT by COUNTRY.
  [ESC]  Will limit by Continent only, and begin mapping or data
  search immediately.
  [Y] You are given a list of Countries to choose from.  
  ONLY records for   selected Continent and Country pass this test.

Limit #5)  TAGGED RECORDS. IF you select this, you may press [T] to
  limit data to TAGGED records ONLY,  or [U] to pass UN-TAGGED records
  only.  All OTHER search limits selected will STILL apply.

Limit #6)  LIMIT by ENVIRONMENT?  [Y/N/X/I]
  [N]   Skips this restriction, it is not used very often.
  [ESC] Terminates search-limits.  Search starts immediately.  
  [Y]   You select ONE "environment"  (Land, Sea, Air.. ) by number.
        Records with any different "environment" are rejected.

Limit #7)  LIMIT by STRANGENESS     [Y/N/X/I]        -and-
Limit #8)  LIMIT by CREDIBILITY     [Y/N/X/I]  are very similar.

  [Y]  You are asked for lower and upper limits for Strangeness and/or
  Credibility.  Range for both is 0-F (hexadecimal) same as a scale of 
  zero to fifteen.  Records WITHIN ranges are selected, others rejected.

Limit #9)  LIMIT by COORDINATES?    [Y/N/X/I]
  IF selected, you are asked for WESTERN and EASTERN LONGITUDE limits,
  then NORTHERN and SOUTHERN Latitude limits.   Press [I] to select only
  events INSIDE these lines ( the default ) or [O] for those OUTSIDE.
  This is not often used.

Limit #10)  LIMIT by REFERENCE NUMBER?   [Y/N/X/I]
  Press [R] to call up the Reference Lookup Window if necessary.
  Enter 3-digit reference number from 000 to 255.

Limit #11)  LIMIT by DATE-TIME ACCURACY? [Y/N/X/I]
  [Y]  You enter a LOWER limit on ACCURACY for Year, Month, Day and
  time fields: ( 3=known, 2=approx. 1=unknown, 0=irrelevant )
  ONLY records that meet or exceed ALL FOUR lower limits will pass.

Limit #12)  LIMIT by HOURS of the DAY?   [Y/N/X/I]
  [Y]  You enter STARTING and ENDING  Hour & Minutes.  Minutes are
  rounded to 10-minute increments.
  => If your Ending time is BEFORE your starting time (e.g. from 2230
     to 0240) the program will ACCEPT this, and assume you want night
     sightings EXTENDING BEYOND MIDNITE into the following mornings. <=




( Appendix I:  Setting Search Limits  cont. )                     [16]

Limit #13)  SELECT SPECIFIC MONTHS?  [Y/N]
[N]  NO.  Data Search, Map or other display begins immediately.
[Y]  YES. You may select one month, or ANY SET of months.
          Use left/right arrow keys to shift between months.
          Press [Insert] to include a month, or [Delete] to disallow it.
          If you select NO months, then ALL months pass the test.
          Press the [Esc] key or DOWN-Arrow when you are done.
          The Data search begins immediately.


Setting proper Search Limits is the heart of any data retrieval.

APPENDIX IV:   The STATE/PROVINCE Field:   Some Notes.

In cases where "Countries" are Lumped together (Britain & Ireland, African 
Sahara or Congo,  Baltic states etc.) the STATE/PROVINCE field is used for 
the actual Country.  This field is limited to 3 Alfa characters:  
  e.g.  EST = Estonia, IVC = Ivory Coast, BLG = Belgium.

For USA, Canada and Mexico enter code for STATE, PROVINCE or TERRITORY.
Use States, Provinces, Cantons, Departments etc. in other countries.

States/Provinces in N. America have very NON-INTUITIVE codes.  If you add 
records, be sure to use the same codes!  This is needed for TIME ZONE 
DISCRIMINATION, and file search purposes.  Some examples are:

  ALS = Alaska.  CLR = Colorado  CNN = Conn.        HWI = Hawaii.
  IOW = IOWA.    MNT = Montana   MSC = Mass.        MSO = Missouri.
  MSP = Miss.    NBR = Nebraska  NCR = N.Carolina.  NDK = N.Dakota.
  OHI = Ohio     ORG = Oregon    SCR = S.Carolina.  SDK = S.Dakota.
  UTA = Utah.    VRG = Virginia  WVA = W.Virginia   WSH = Washington

Mexican States are similarly coded.  SNL=Sinaloa.  CHH= Chihuahua...

Canadian Provinces and Territories likewise:   
  ALB = Alberta        BCO = British Columbia   MBA = Manitoba        
  NBR = New Brunswick  NFL = Newfoundland.      NSC = Nova Scotia     
  NWT = NW Territories ONT = Ontario            QBC = Quebec          
  SSK = Sasketchewan   YUK = Yukon     PEI = Prince Edward Island.       



( State / Province field,  cont. )                           [20]

In France abbreviate the Department (one out of 90)
Australia, Brazil, Germany.. : Enter State Code.
Benelux, Scandanavia ..       Enter the country.
Spain, Portugal, Italy.. :   Enter the Province.
Britain/Ireland enter the "Country": IRL, NI, SCT, WAL, ENG.

For countries with obscure subdivisions, use nearest major city.

APPENDIX V:  TEXT SYNOPSIS FIELD:  Abbreviations and Acronyms.

The Synopsis Field is 78 alpha characters.  Space limitations require
many acronyns and abbreviations.  The following conventions are used:

   /     :  ANY preposition: of, for, from, in, according to..
   ><    :  Between (2 places)
   >> or>:  Between (2 places) going toward 2nd.
   >E >W >NW >SSE   Going East, West etc.  Double arrow >> denotes speed.
   __++  :  __ and more.  __ to the max.
   100s/ :  Hundreds of ___     1000s/  Thousands of __
   2x,3x :  Twice, three times..
   nn K' :  nn Thousand Feet (Altitude).
   @     :  At               ( plus many more. )

==>  Press the [F5] key from the MAIN MENU, EXAMINE/Edit screens and when 
     entering Sighting synopses, to look up unfamiliar abbreviations and 
     acronyms.  Poussez le [F7] pour la francaise brouille!  <==

APPENDIX  VI:      REFERENCES:

==>  Press [R] from the MAIN MENU, EXAMINE/EDIT and Reference entry screen 
to call the References pop-up window.  From the EXAMINE/EDIT screen, first 
Reference shown will match the Active Record.  Use the UP/DOWN Arrow keys 
to step UP/DOWN by one reference number.  Use the [Page-up]/[Page-Dn] keys 
to jump ten references. Press [Ctrl] [arrow-key] to jump ten references. <==

References are numbered ( 000-255 in no particular order), subject to change 
as sources are added or reclassified.   Book references provide a page number 
from 0-999.  Journals give Volume/Issue number, but not page numbers.

For References #93 (footnotes/newspapers), #97 (miscellaneous journals) 
and #98 (misc. books),  press Ctrl-R for the actual source or footnote. 

These are sources which provide few *U* listings.  For other reference
numbers Ctrl-R gives full publishing data instead.

Ctrl-R data comes from the text-file USOURCES.DOC which is unpacked
when you install *U*.  From the Examine/Edit screen, you can browse
through USOURCES.DOC.   Press the [L] key, and enter a search-word.

For example, type in VALLEE.  Press the space-bar to step through
several listings.   

USOURCES.DOC is quite a bibliography in itself.  Feel free to use it.  
A reference back to this database would be kindly appreciated of course.



APPENDIX VII   *** PLANETARY POSITIONS ***               [21]

Planetary positions are shown 2 ways:

1)   From the EXAMINE/EDIT (text) display, press the [P] key.  Horizon
Coordinates (Azimuth/Altitude) plus distance show the apparent position 
of 6 visible planets at the date/time of the Active Record.  
Press [P] again to toggle between displays.

2)   By choosing Option [A] (ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK) from Statistics Menu.
YOUR date and time show at the upper right.  Press [D] to adjust your date; 
press [T] to set your Local time.   UTC is the same as Greenwich GMT, and 
does NOT change for Daylight-Savings.  "Julian Day" is the number of days 
since January 1, 4713 B.C.  GST is Greenwich SIDEREAL (not Standard) time.  
LST is YOUR local Sidereal (astronomical) time.  Accuracy for Horizon 
coordinates depends upon accurate Time Zone, Daylight Savings, and your 
geographical coordinates (Long/Lat.).   Press [Z] to set your Time Zone 
and Daylight or Standard time flag.   Press [L] to enter or change your 
local Coordinates.

Earth's Solar Longitude is with respect to the Vernal Equinox.  "Ecliptic" 
is Earth's obliquity or tilt with respect to the ecliptic plane, and changes 
slowly as the Earth "wobbles".  Moon Phase is the percent of the Moon's face 
illuminated by the Sun, as seen from Earth.

Solar and Geocentric Longitudes are on the Ecliptic, with the Vernal Equinox 
in Pisces as zero-degree reference.   All planets and moon orbit CCW through 
360 degrees, as seen from the North Star.

Right Ascension (RA) and Declination are EQUATORIAL coordinates, to locate 
planets with respect to fixed stars per astronomical convention.

Horizon Coordinates  (Azimuth & Altitude) DEPEND ENTIRELY on accurate Local 
Date, Time, DST and Coordinates.  0 degrees Azimuth is due North.
"Altitude" is the angle of elevation up from the horizon in degrees.

==> Planets with a NEGATIVE altitude are below the horizon i.e. invisible!

Your Time Zone may include a 1 hour offset for DST.  Thus Pacific STANDARD 
time is 8 hours behind UTC, while PDT is only 7 hours behind.  The display 
updates once per second with an audible "tick".  Press [S] for a silent clock.  
Press [Esc] to exit.

Press [H] to enter any HYPOTHETICAL set of Coordinates, date, time, DST etc.   
The Hypothetical coordinates default to the LAST ACTIVE RECORD displayed in 
the EXAMINE/EDIT screen.  You can check if Venus was actually in the sky 
during any recorded sighting, for example.

Press [R] to return to the ticking Realtime display for YOUR area.

ACCURACY: Double-Precision variables are used throughout.  Routines account 
for Earths Obliquity, Planetary eccentricity and inclination.  Mean anomalies 
are recursively zeroed for true ecliptic longitudes.  Several Epochs were 
"averaged" for "mean longitudes at epoch" and ascending nodes.   

Perturbations, precession, refraction, relativistic effects and parallax 
errors (generally small) are NOT factored in or corrected here.
      
The Moon is corrected  for Sun-Earth Variation, evection and other factors.

Maximum error is about 2 degrees, usually much less.  Figures have up to 
4 decimals to show RELATIVE changes BUT should only be considered accurate 
to about a 10th of a degree at best!     


APPENDIX  VIII:     PROBLEM SOLVING.                      [22]

1]  THE PROGRAM WORKS EXCEPT FOR THE MAPS.  THEY ARE DISTORTED,
    OVERWRITTEN, and/or MY SYSTEM CRASHES WHEN I DISPLAY MAPS.
    >>  Standard VGA 640x480 16-color video is a system requirement.
        Old EGA or CGA video is obsolete and simply don't work.

2]  I GET an ERROR MESSAGE: FAILED opening U.RND (or other file)
    >>  ALL *U* FILES MUST be in the SAME SUBDIRECTORY, usually C:\UFO.
        This occurs automatically at installation.

3]  "INSUFFICIENT CORE MEMORY"  -or-  "MEMORY ALLOCATION FAILURE"..
    >>  You have run out of memory.  *U* requires 1MB (megabyte) of user
      memory.   CLOSE all programs, and execute *U* by itself.
    See README.DOC for other possible tips.

5]  I get a red message like "INTERNAL MATH ERROR" and *U* just stops.
    >>  Please report problems like this to Larry Hatch via email:
        < larry@larryhatch.net >.  These may indicate programming errors.

6]  My printer won't print *U* data, or just locks up!
    >>  *U* presumes your PARALLEL printer is connected via a standard
      DB-25 cable to the LPT1 PARALLEL PRINTER PORT at the rear of your
      computer, sometimes with a Buffer Device in between.  IF you have
      any OTHER arrangement, *U* cannot possibly anticipate it.  One
      solution is a printer switch with an extra cable.  This switches
      the LPT1 output between devices.

      Remember:  Only the CANON BJ-200e or exact equivalent can print
      out GRAPHICS screens directly from within *U*.   Use [Shift]
      [Print Scrn] in Windows to print these screens on other printers.

      All printers will print text or numbers data directly.

7]  How do I capture images I can send over the Internet?

    >> Press [Alt][Print Scrn].   Then call Microsoft Paint.  Click on
    Edit.   Click on PASTE in the little pop-up window.  Click on File
    and then SAVE to name and save the image.   These are typically large 
    bitmapped (.bmp) files.   Try using Paintshop Pro to convert the image
    to a .GIF file.   This will reduce the file to a fraction of its
    former size, with no loss of fidelity.   

8]  My installation diskette seems to have self-destructed.

    >> 1)  You left it on the heater, or too close to a magnet.
       2)  The dog tried to eat it.
       3)  You tried to install *U* on too many different computers.
       
    Email <larry@larryhatch.net> and ask for assistance.




The UTILITIES MENU:  File Maintenance Routines.           [23]

Press the [U] key from main menu to access this Utilities Menu.

EXIT to Main Menu .. press [Esc] or [0] key.

ABOUT the *U* Database  ..  press [1].

Contact information for Larry Hatch Software.

TAG BAD COORDINATES  .....  press [2] 

This is a rough scan of all listings looking for places in the wrong   
hemisphere etc.   Records with obviously flawed longitude/latitude are 
TAGGED  ( shown in green ) to facilitate locating and fixing errors.

There is a special "search limit" that zeroes in on tagged
records.   Make sure you untag other records before you
use Utility #2, to avoid confusion.

TAG UNFOUND LOCATIONS ....  press [3]

Sightings marked CF or QF were never found on a map or gazetteer. 
This routine TAGS these records for easy retrieval.  By 2001 most
of these were found or delisted.  A few might have been ficticious!

ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK (again). press [A] ...

Be sure and check that the local coordinate shown are your own where 
you execute *U*,  and that the proper time zone is entered!  Press Z 
to adjust time zone.  Press L to set coordinates.  Your local time is 
taken from your system clock and cannot be adjusted here.  Note the 
positions of the planets,  and check them outdoors.  Its fun!

DUPLICATE COORDINATES  ...  press [D] ...

Often, there are numerous records for the same city.  To show this on 
the maps, each sighting is offset by fractions of degrees long/lat.  
This option tags records with identical coordinates, so one or the other 
may be pushed aside a bit!

EXPORT ASCII FILE  ......   press [E] ...

For the sake of statistical studies using other applications, this 
option allows the user to create and name an ASCII text file, and send 
to any drive A-D.  Exportable fields are year, month, day of month, day 
of year (1-366), long/lat coordinates, time of day, and strangeness and 
credibility codes.
Other fields are not exportable to avoid software piracy.

Each field ends with a TAB ( Ascii 9) for nice even columns.   Each line 
ends with a Carriage Return/Line-feed ( 0D0A hex ).  The file produced 
ends with an EOF ( FF hex ) terminator byte.

SORT RECORDS INTO ORDER .   press [S] ...

This routine puts all records back into strict chronological order by 
LOCAL date and time-of-day.   DELETED records  [ which are marked by 
the unlikely year 3000 ad ] will sort down to the end of the data file.  


                                                                [24]
   
Some final notes ..
								                  
*U* draws from the hard work of thousands in UFO investigation and research 
over five decades.   Nobody can promise complete accuracy.  Every reasonable 
effort is made to cross-check sources for data, date time and so on.  
=> Please email < larry@larryhatch.net > if you find factual errors. <=

IF you cannot find a well-known sighting, it may have been delisted.   
Some well known but discredited sightings are listed in USOURCES.DOC.  
Use the [L] lookup routine to see if it went to the dog-house.   
Night-Lights and similar low-information sightings are no longer listed.  

The precise Longitude/Latitude of sightings has been painstakingly determined 
for thousands of cases, often requiring expensive foreign maps etc.  Some 
places are yet to be found, a few may not even exist!   These are marked 
CF or QF for "Can't Find" and "Ready to delist" in the Text field.   Some 
QF events are left in the data to avoid duplicated efforts.   A long sad 
series of lost place-names appears in USOURCES.DOC.

Select Option #3 from the UTILITIES Menu to display or print a list 
of still sought-after "phantom" locations ( CF and QF sightings )
