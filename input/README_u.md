# README.DOC   
## Updated instructions for the *U* UFO DATABASE    23AUG2003

The complete set of files for installation should include the following:


    INSTALL.EXE     INSTALL.CFG    U.PCK DC.PCK    
    and README.DOC (this file)  


Instructions:
      
      *U* installs automatically, but FIRST:
      
> DO YOU ALREADY HAVE a  C:\UFO subdirectory on your C: Hard Drive?
   IF NOT, skip ahead to INSTALLATION below.

   IF you DO have a C:\UFO subdirectory on your C: hard drive, 
   CHECK IT NOW, and make sure that NO FILES already in your
   C:\UFO subdirectory exactly match the following:

      U.EXE     U.RND      INSTALL.EXE  WM.VCE    U.PCK    DC.PCK
      README.DOC  (this file)      USOURCES.DOC
      UENGLISH.TXT   UFRENCH.TXT   

   You will need to RENAME or MOVE any such files to a different
   subdirectory, or or *U* will OVERWRITE (destroy) them.

   UPGRADING SUSCRIBERS:   BEFORE INSTALLING the new version:
   IF you have added your own sightings to the ones sent with your ORIGINAL
   version of *U*, you will need to save these somehow, as the NEW diskette
   will OVERWRITE all the original files!


INSTALLATION: ( Requires 4.3 MB free hard disk space temporarily.
		Final space is about 3.3 MB fully installed. )

WINDOWS 95/98/ME users:
 > Insert diskette in 3.5" (90mm) floppy drive.
 > From DESKTOP screen, click on MY COMPUTER; and then Floppy drive
    (usually A: - drive)
 > Click on the INSTALL icon within the A-drive window.
    You may want to create a 'Shortcut' to *U* on your desktop.

 NOTE:  You may see a false "OUT OF MEMORY" error message on the
 first execution of *U*.   IGNORE this .. it is due to the program
 and installation software hogging the same memory space.

   This completes installation procedure. For subsequent sessions,
   change to C:/UFO and execute U.EXE to run the program.

   Your C:\UFO directory should now have the following files:
       U.EXE      U.RND      WM.VCE       README.DOC
       README.BAT    USOURCES.DOC  

       UENGLISH.TXT  UFRENCH.TXT are NOT included for space
       reasons.  Email Larry Hatch to get these! 
       
=> To EXECUTE *U* on subsequent sittings, change to C:\UFO directory,
   and simply type  U [Enter].
   MOST systems can execute *U* directly from WINDOWS.

=> Store your original diskette in a safe place as a backup.

 Your 24-page USERS MANUAL will be sent via email attachment.
     
 1) The file USOURCES.DOC is Unpacked at INSTALLATION time.  This file is
 in plain American ASCII code, and may be read or edited from any standard
 word-processor or text editor program.    USOURCES lists references with 
 full publishing data to help document cases.
 Press the L key from EXAMINE/EDIT screen to search through this file.

 2) *U* now has over 18,150 quality sightings, about 8200 more than in 1994
 when *U* was first offered.    Many poorer sightings (little data..) were
 replaced with better ones.  *U* data are updated regularly. You are always 
 sent the very latest version.

 3) *U* records are in strict chronological order.  Record numbers will 
 vary!  Please refer to listings by Place, Date and Time instead.

 4) CHECK your time and location:  From the UTILITIES or STATISTICS menu,
 select Option A.   Note the Longitude, Latitude and Time-Zone on the
 ASTRONOMY CLOCK screen.   IF time or coordinates shown do NOT correspond
 to yours, follow screen instructions to reset them.

 Be sure to RESET the time in Spring and Fall, when Daylight Savings
 (summer) time changes for most places!   In North America, D.S.T.
 places your local time one hour CLOSER to Greenwich GMT (London).
 GMT/UTC does NOT observe Daylight Savings!  

 5)  Special references:   Ref. numbers 93 (newpapers/footnotes), 97
 (Other Periodicals) and 98 (Other Books) refer to sources with very
 few *U* listings.   IF a non-zero PAGE NUMBER is given, press Ctrl-R
 (hold Control key and press R).   This will call up the footnote or
 reference from the file USOURCES.DOC.   For regularly numbered sources,
 Ctrl-R will call up publishing information ( year, origin, publisher..)

 6)  Press the L key from the Examine/Edit (text) screen to browse the
 USOURCES file by search words.   Listings with matching phrases will
 appear in sequence;  a good way to look up all sorts of stuff.

 7)  The old files UCF.EXE and UFIX.EXE are ABOLISHED.   The routines
 formerly in these stand-alone programs are now incorporated into the
 single executable file U.EXE, under a new UTILITIES MENU (see below)

 8)  The new UTILITIES MENU is Option [U] on the Main Menu.
 This menu now has the options formerly in separate programs UFIX.EXE
 and UCF.EXE.   Specifically:

   Option [1]  ABOUT the *U* Database:  Gives address and telephone
   for sales and assistance.

   Option [2]  MARK BAD COORDINATES is new.   This routine searches for
   Longitude/Latitude grossly out of place for each given Continent and
   Country.   If any are found, the record is 'Tagged' (gets a green
   background).   To find and edit these clinkers,  use Main Menu Option
   #1 (records Examine/Edit) and press the [V] key.    Ordinarily you
   will find nothing, unless you have been editing or adding records.

   Option [3]  LIST PHANTOM LOCATIONS:   This is the same as the UCF.EXE
   program, now removed.   You may list these on-screen, or print them
   out as before.   Any help finding these pieces of abducted geography
   will be highly appreciated.

   Options [4] and [5] are for future expansion, not yet implimented.

   Option [A] is the Astronomical Clock.   The Astro-clock may also be
   called from the Statistics Menu for the time being.

   Option [D] DUPLICATE COORDINATES is the same as the routine formerly
   in UFIX.EXE.   Please see the Manual under UFIX.EXE for full details.

   Option [E] EXPORT ASCII FILES has been moved here from the Statistics
   Menu (where it did not properly fit in).  See the Manual under the
   Statistics Menu for full details.   The routine is unchanged.

   Option [S] SORTS RECORDS into strict chronological order.   This is
   necessary whenevery you add new records, since these fall wherever
   there is an empty "slot".

   The Escape [Esc] key returns you to the main menu.

9) New Statistics option [D]  Day / Night sightings counts.   Recent
statistical findings suggested a breakdown of sightings by day and night,
over decades.   This option only counts sightings with 'known' time-of-
day; plus or minus one hour to allow for time zone vagaries and daylight-
savings [summer] time.   About 3/4 of the data meets these requirements.

Note the ratio of DAY sightings counts before 1960 and compare this to
the statistics after 1960..

10) Versions after March, 2000 ( Serial numbers > 0307 ) have a 
reorganized array of Attributes.  The bottom (8th) row was formerly :
MIL  BBK  FBI  CIA  NSA  OGA  COV  CMF, which differentiated between
different security agencies possibly involved in certain sightings.

This bottom row now hold the fields:
MIL  BBK  GSA  OGA  SND  ODR  COV  CMF. 

The various security agencies are now grouped under one Attribute (GSA) 
for Government Security Agencies, both foreign and domestic.  This is more 
efficient in terms of information theory, and frees up two slots for
SND  and ODR,  i.e.  Sounds and Odors associated with UFO sightings.

Searching by these attributes alone will quickly show the amazing diversity
of sounds and smells reported.   Previously, these had to be retrieved by
a distressingly long list of unlikely search words;  e.g. Garlic, Screech!

Individual security agencies are still identified in the text field as in
" CIA report " etc.

OGA  ( Other Government Agencies ) refers to police, NASA, FAA and other
non-covert agencies which were reportedly involved.  Local, regional and
foreign national police agencies account for the majority of these.
This field was moved to the left for logical reasons.

Other fields remain unchanged.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = =

11)  BOOLEAN OPERATORS ( AND / OR ) for Attributes when used as Search
Limits.   *U* always allowed filtering data by any or all of 64 Attributes.
In the past, this was a logical 'OR', which meant that any record meeting
ANY chosen search attribute would pass the filter.

*U* versions after 10 July 1999 allow the user to select the AND option,
which means that ALL search attributes selected must be present in a
record for it to pass the filter.

In addition,  these same AND / OR boolean operators can be used to REJECT
records .. passing all those which to NOT meet the AND / OR criteria.

Confusing?    Please simply experiment!    It will become quite clear to
the logically non-challenged.

Please email Larry Hatch at < help@larryhatch.net > for further questions.    
This is by far the fastest and surest way to get a prompt response.

Also please see the ( official! )  *U* UFO DATABASE Website at:

 http://www.larryhatch.net 

This site is frequently updated, and offers many screens directly from
*U*.   Some of the maps and statistics screens there may suggest further
experiments with your own copy of *U*.
